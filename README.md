# YJTV-media-website


## Description
This is an EXTREMELY SIMPLE media storage website for YJTV. It is a SIMPLE website that allows users to upload and download media files. It is built using Node.js and Express. This project will not be updated as I needed it briefly many years ago and I am no longer part of YJTV.
